Train-Up! was for a short time a premium WordPress plugin. As of Febuary 2015 it is now open source. The reasoning for this move is a combination of difficulties in providing support to customers and recent changes to VAT law that affect micro business.

For those who purchased Train-Up! in the last 12 months you can still get support by emailing wptrainup at wptrainup dot co dot uk and providing your licence number.
