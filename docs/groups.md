Groups
======

[Trainees](trainees.md), [Levels](levels.md) and [Group managers](group_managers.md) can be put in one or more Groups. 

This does two things:

1. Allows you to limit levels to a particular group(s) of trainees
2. Allows group managers to see the results of trainees who are in groups that they are a manager of.

##### Example
Think of groups as tags. You are essentially 'tagging' trainees. This is a flexible way of organising your trainees. For example:

     Bob  could be tagged with "Semester 1", 2014 and "Maths"
     Fred could be tagged with "Semester 2", 2014 and "Biology"
     
If you were to do the above, you could then restrict the Level "Maths Level 1â€³ to all users tagged with Maths. So Bob could access it, but Fred could not (because he is studying Biology).

##### Group performance
The [Archive](archive.md) feature shows which Group is performing the best for a given Test.
