Group managers
==============

Group managers are a new user role for your WordPress installation.

Group managers have a subset of administrator permissions. They can view the [Results](results.md) of trainees who are in the [Groups](groups.md) that they themselves are a manager of. Here is an example:

* Joe Bloggs is in Group A
* Fred Smith is in no Groups
* Jane Jones is in Group D

As a Group manager of Groups A, B and C you have the ability to view both Joe's and Fred's test results but not Janes. This is because: 

* Joe is in Group A (and you are a manager of group A), and
* Fred is un-grouped (meaning that nobody is 'in charge' of him)

##### Roles and capabilities

If you are looking for more granular control over what Group managers can do, there are [filters](filters.md) available so you can customise their capabilities manually. Or, we recommend using the [Members plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/).
