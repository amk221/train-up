Pages
=====

Like many plugins, Train-Up! requires you install some pages to make it work, but rather than cluttering up your existing pages section in WordPress, Train-Up! kindly puts them in their own section.

This is also a great place to put content that is not specific to a [level](levels.md), like a glossary or an FAQ.
