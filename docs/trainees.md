Trainees
========

Trainees are a new user role for your WordPress installation. They cannot access the backend.

With the Train-Up! plugin users can register as a Trainee. 'My account' functionality is provided out of the box, allowing trainees to edit their details, view their test [results](results.md), see which [levels](levels.md) they can access, and more.

Trainees can be assigned to one or more [Groups](groups.md), this is useful for limiting which [Levels](levels.md) they have access to.
